<UL>

<LI> <A href="ctcheat.pdf">ctcheat.pdf</a> The all-in-one (or at least,
as-far-as-I've-gotten-in-one) glossary.  It attempts to make quantifiers
explicit in diagrams, because people have found that very helpful.</LI>

<LI> <A href="adjoints-diag.pdf">adjoints-diag.pdf</A> works out the left
and right adjoints to the diagonal product functor.  Specifically, Σ ⊣ ∆ ⊣
Π. </LI>

<LI> <A href="bifunctors.pdf">bifunctors.pdf</a> Notes on bifunctors as in
the excellent paper <A
href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/daniel.james/functor/functor.pdf">Functional
Pearl: F for Functor</A>.  This attempts to slow down and flesh out the
discussion a little bit.</LI>

<LI> <A href="ends.pdf">ends.pdf</a> extends <A
href="bifunctors.pdf">bifunctors.pdf</a> to consider the ends of
profunctors, especially as pertains to functional programming languages with
higher-order (i.e. non-prenex) quantification.

<LI> <A href="monads.pdf">monads.pdf</a> is some old notes about categorical
monads and Haskell.</LI>

<LI> <A href="yoneda.pdf">yoneda.pdf</a> Some worked examples leading up to
the Yoneda Lemma.</LI>

</UL>

TeX for all of this is up at
<A href="https://github.com/nwf/ctcheat">github</A>. <p/>

More forthcoming, I'm sure.
